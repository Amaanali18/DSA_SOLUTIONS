## Problem Statement

A string is a *valid parentheses string*&nbsp;(denoted VPS) if and only if it consists of `&quot;(&quot;` and `&quot;)&quot;` characters only, and:

	- It is the empty string, or

	- It can be written as&nbsp;`AB`&nbsp;(`A`&nbsp;concatenated with&nbsp;`B`), where&nbsp;`A`&nbsp;and&nbsp;`B`&nbsp;are VPS&#39;s, or

	- It can be written as&nbsp;`(A)`, where&nbsp;`A`&nbsp;is a VPS.

We can&nbsp;similarly define the *nesting depth* `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:

	- `depth(&quot;&quot;) = 0`

	- `depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where `A` and `B` are VPS&#39;s

	- `depth(&quot;(&quot; + A + &quot;)&quot;) = 1 + depth(A)`, where `A` is a VPS.

For example, `&quot;&quot;`,&nbsp;`&quot;()()&quot;`, and&nbsp;`&quot;()(()())&quot;`&nbsp;are VPS&#39;s (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and `&quot;)(&quot;` and `&quot;(()&quot;` are not VPS&#39;s.

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B`, such that&nbsp;`A` and `B` are VPS&#39;s (and&nbsp;`A.length + B.length = seq.length`). The subsequences may not necessarily be contiguous.

For example, for the sequence `123456789`, one possible split is:

	
	A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`,
	

	
	B = {2, 4, 6, 8}`.
	

This corresponds to the output `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]` &nbsp;where 0 indicates membership in&nbsp;A`&nbsp;and 1 indicates membership in&nbsp;B`.

Now choose **any** such `A` and `B` such that&nbsp;`max(depth(A), depth(B))` is the minimum possible value.

Return an `answer` array (of length `seq.length`) that encodes such a&nbsp;choice of `A` and `B`:&nbsp; `answer[i] = 0` if `seq[i]` is part of `A`, else `answer[i] = 1`.&nbsp; Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

&nbsp;

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** seq = &quot;(()())&quot;
**Output:** [0,1,1,1,1,0]

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** seq = &quot;()(())()&quot;
**Output:** [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]

```

&nbsp;

**Constraints:**

	- `1 &lt;= seq.size &lt;= 10000`
