## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a **non-empty** key.

	- For example, in the string `&quot;(name)is(age)yearsold&quot;`, there are **two** bracket pairs that contain the keys `&quot;name&quot;` and `&quot;age&quot;`.

You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.

You are tasked to evaluate **all** of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:

	- Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key&#39;s corresponding `valuei`.

	- If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with a question mark `&quot;?&quot;` (without the quotation marks).

Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.

Return *the resulting string after evaluating **all** of the bracket pairs.*

&nbsp;

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** s = &quot;(name)is(age)yearsold&quot;, knowledge = [[&quot;name&quot;,&quot;bob&quot;],[&quot;age&quot;,&quot;two&quot;]]
**Output:** &quot;bobistwoyearsold&quot;
**Explanation:**
The key &quot;name&quot; has a value of &quot;bob&quot;, so replace &quot;(name)&quot; with &quot;bob&quot;.
The key &quot;age&quot; has a value of &quot;two&quot;, so replace &quot;(age)&quot; with &quot;two&quot;.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** s = &quot;hi(name)&quot;, knowledge = [[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]]
**Output:** &quot;hi?&quot;
**Explanation:** As you do not know the value of the key &quot;name&quot;, replace &quot;(name)&quot; with &quot;?&quot;.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** s = &quot;(a)(a)(a)aaa&quot;, knowledge = [[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;]]
**Output:** &quot;yesyesyesaaa&quot;
**Explanation:** The same key can appear multiple times.
The key &quot;a&quot; has a value of &quot;yes&quot;, so replace all occurrences of &quot;(a)&quot; with &quot;yes&quot;.
Notice that the &quot;a&quot;s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.

```

&nbsp;

**Constraints:**

	- `1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 105`

	- `0 &lt;= knowledge.length &lt;= 105`

	- `knowledge[i].length == 2`

	- `1 &lt;= keyi.length, valuei.length &lt;= 10`

	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters and round brackets `&#39;(&#39;` and `&#39;)&#39;`.

	- Every open bracket `&#39;(&#39;` in `s` will have a corresponding close bracket `&#39;)&#39;`.

	- The key in each bracket pair of `s` will be non-empty.

	- There will not be any nested bracket pairs in `s`.

	- `keyi` and `valuei` consist of lowercase English letters.

	- Each `keyi` in `knowledge` is unique.
